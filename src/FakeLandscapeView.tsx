  // transition, where the ambient default would be momentarily wrong mid-fade.

// Wraps `children` in whatever rotation keeps it gravity-upright for however the device is

//
// A 90°/-90° rotation swaps the content's effective footprint (what was width becomes height), so
// those two cases render into an inner container explicitly sized/centered for the swap — the
// standard "fake landscape inside a portrait-locked app" trick — rather than just rotating in place,
// which would clip against the real (unswapped, portrait-shaped) window. 180° doesn't change the
// footprint at all, so it skips straight to a plain rotate.
//
// Safe for tap-driven content — React Native's own touch responder system hit-tests against the
// rendered/transformed layout correctly. NOT safe for continuous gesture tracking
// (react-native-gesture-handler's translation deltas read raw, untransformed native coordinates) —
// never wrap the game board/touch layer in this.

  // subscribed to the same live source one level up for its own reasons, so this doesn't introduce
  // a new re-render trigger in practice — just some discarded work within a render already happening.
