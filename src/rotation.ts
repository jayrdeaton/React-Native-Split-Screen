// to portrait permanently at the OS level (see useAccelerometerOrientation's own top comment) — the
// render surface itself never rotates anymore, so without this, content stays glued to the device's
// own physical top edge no matter which way the device is turned; today's existing "unrotated in
// sideBySide" behavior only ever made sense when the OS was the one doing the actual rotating.
//
// sideBySide's rotation direction is tied to p1OnRight (already resolved against the same physical
// hold), not computed independently — there's no separate "upside-down landscape" case, only two
// landscape directions total. faceToFace ignores p1OnRight entirely and just applies upsideDown's
// own flip. Verified against a real device: p1OnRight's sign (from useAccelerometerOrientation)
// needed the OPPOSITE rotation from the first guess to read right-side-up — flip back here (not
// there) if a future hardware change ever needs it, since p1OnRight's own left/right meaning was
// separately confirmed correct on the same device.

// of a portrait-locked screen, never reflowing into left/right the way DualZoneLayout's own panels
// do — only a genuine landscape hold means anything. Two seats held side by side (landscape) read
// the screen the same way up, so that tilt rotates both zones' content identically — see
// getOpposingZoneRotation below for the one place they then differ. A portrait tilt, "upside down"
// or not, doesn't correspond to anything real for this layout: the zones can't swap which physical
// seat each is nearest just because the device got spun while lying flat, so unlike getViewRotation's
// own faceToFace branch, this deliberately never applies its 180° upside-down flip — content just
// stays at 0° for any portrait-like reading.

// reads the identical rotation, unchanged. Portrait (0°/180°): the two seats sit across the device
// from each other, so the opposing seat's content needs the other of the two portrait angles to
// read right-side-up from their side — the same fixed flip a static 2-player face-to-face layout
// has always needed, just generalized to ride on top of whatever getFixedZoneRotation produced.
