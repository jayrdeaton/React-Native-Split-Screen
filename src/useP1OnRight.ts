// matters: whichever edge was nearest P1 in portrait (the bottom) swings to a different physical
// side depending on which way the device rotates, so keeping P1 attached to "wherever they
// physically ended up" (rather than a side that's fixed no matter which way you turn) needs the
// real LANDSCAPE_LEFT/RIGHT reading, not just width > height.
//
// Verified empirically against the iOS Simulator's own Device > Rotate Left/Right commands (not
// assumed from Apple's naming, which reads backwards from what it does): rotating a portrait
// device to the left reports LANDSCAPE_RIGHT, and rotating it to the right reports LANDSCAPE_LEFT.
// Physically, rotating left swings the bottom edge (P1's zone) around to the right — so
// LANDSCAPE_RIGHT is the state where P1 belongs on the right, and LANDSCAPE_LEFT is where P1
// belongs on the left.
